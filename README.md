# Onboarding Instructions

### When working on an issue, follow these steps:

1. **Fork a branch** from `main`:
   - Name your branch following this format: `issue-number`-`short-description` (e.g., `54-updated-API-tokens`).
  
2. **Move the Trello card**:
   - Move the card associated with the issue into the **Doing** column on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/6700464232720f5b5401a922/ATTIe089b41ca2cef2ef44ba6eb1601b295eAD176CB8/brown-fsae-testing-app).
   
3. **Complete your work**:
   - Develop the solution and commit your changes to the new branch.
   
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Once you're finished, submit a PR from your branch to the `main` branch.
   - In the PR description, reference the issue number and provide a brief summary of the changes made.

5. **Move the Trello card to QA**:
   - After creating the PR, move the corresponding Trello card into the **QA** column to indicate that it's ready for review.

6. **Wait for approval**:
   - The leads will review and approve your PR. Once approved, they will merge your branch into `main`.

7. **Mark as Done**:
   - After the PR is merged, move the Trello card into the **Done** column.
