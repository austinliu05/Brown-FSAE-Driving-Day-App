# Onboarding Instructions

### When working on an issue, follow these steps:

1. **Fork a branch** from `main`:
   - Name your branch following this format: `issue-number`-`short-description` (e.g., `54-updated-API-tokens`).
  
2. **Move the Trello card**:
   - Move the card associated with the issue into the **Doing** column on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/6700464232720f5b5401a922/ATTIe089b41ca2cef2ef44ba6eb1601b295eAD176CB8/brown-fsae-testing-app).
   
3. **Complete your work**:
   - Develop the solution and commit your changes to the new branch.
   
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Once you're finished, submit a PR from your branch to the `main` branch.
   - In the PR description, reference the issue number and provide a **verbose** and clear summary of the changes made. Include relevant details like risks, assumptions, or areas needing further review.

5. **Move the Trello card to QA**:
   - After creating the PR, move the corresponding Trello card into the **QA** column to indicate that it's ready for review.
   - **Ping the assignee on Slack** to notify them that the PR is ready for testing.

6. **Wait for approval**:
   - The leads will review and approve your PR. Once approved, **only leads will merge** your branch into `main`.

7. **Mark as Done**:
   - After the PR is merged, move the Trello card into the **Done** column.

### Meeting Format: Risks, Blockers, Accomplishments, and Future Plans

During team meetings, we will follow this structure for updates:

1. **Risks**:
   - Share any potential risks or challenges that might impact the project or the timeline.
   
2. **Blockers**:
   - Discuss any blockers that are preventing progress on your tasks. If applicable, suggest possible solutions or who might be able to help.

3. **Accomplishments**:
   - Briefly describe what you have completed since the last meeting. Be **verbose** to provide a clear picture of your progress and how it fits into the project goals.

4. **Future Plans**:
   - Outline your next steps and what you plan to work on before the next meeting.

Be **detailed and thorough** when providing updates, as this helps the entire team stay aligned and identify any issues early. It's better to over-communicate than under-communicate, so donâ€™t hesitate to share as much information as possible.

### Additional Notes:
- Once an issue is completed, **move it into QA and ping the assignee** on Slack.
- Only leads will have the responsibility of merging branches into the `main` branch after a thorough review.
