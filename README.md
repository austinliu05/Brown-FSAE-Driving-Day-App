# Onboarding Instructions

### When working on an issue, follow these steps:

1. **Fork a branch** from `main`:
   - Name your branch following this format: `label/team/issue-title` (e.g., `frontend/feature/1-Create-React-Project `).
  
2. **Move the Trello card**:
   - Move the card associated with the issue into the **Doing** column on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/6700464232720f5b5401a922/ATTIe089b41ca2cef2ef44ba6eb1601b295eAD176CB8/brown-fsae-testing-app).
   
3. **Complete your work**:
   - Develop the solution and commit your changes to the new branch.
   
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Once you're finished, submit a PR from your branch to the `main` branch.
   - In the PR description, reference the issue number and provide a **verbose** and clear summary of the changes made. Include relevant details like risks, assumptions, or areas needing further review.

5. **Move the Trello card to QA**:
   - After creating the PR, move the corresponding Trello card into the **QA** column to indicate that it's ready for review.
   - **Ping the assignee on Slack** to notify them that the PR is ready for testing.

6. **Wait for approval**:
   - The leads will review and approve your PR. Once approved, **only leads will merge** your branch into `main`.

7. **Mark as Done**:
   - After the PR is merged, move the Trello card into the **Done** column.

### Using the Template Card

1. **Create Cards from the Template**:
   - When working on new issues or tasks, always start by using the **Template Card**.
   - Ensure that all fields are filled out **thoroughly** with the required information such as the issue number, task description, and any relevant links.

2. **Verify Issue Number and Title**:
   - Double-check that the **issue number** in the Trello card and GitHub branch are correct.
   - Make sure the **title** of the Trello card and the GitHub PR is clear, descriptive, and follows the correct naming conventions.

3. **Task Summary**:
   - The **Task Summary** section in the card should include a brief but comprehensive description of the issue or task.
   - Include links to the GitHub issue and PR in the designated sections.

4. **Checklist**:
   - Follow the checklist in the card template to ensure no steps are missed, from the start of the task to submitting the PR and moving the card through QA.

### Trello Board Setup and Prioritization

1. **Priority System**:
   - The Trello board is organized so that **cards higher up** in each column represent tasks with **higher priority**.
   - When moving tasks between columns (from **To Do** to **Doing**, and then to **QA**), always ensure that the most important tasks are at the **top** of the column.

2. **Tracking Progress**:
   - Move cards between columns as you work through them: **To Do** → **Doing** → **QA** → **Done**.
   - Use the **priority system** to help manage workload effectively, focusing on the most critical tasks first.

3. **Communication**:
   - Ensure clear communication when an issue is ready for review by pinging the relevant team members on Slack.
   - Regularly update the card with any blockers or additional information to keep the team informed.

### Meeting Format: Risks, Blockers, Accomplishments, and Future Plans

During team meetings, we will follow this structure for updates:

1. **Risks**:
   - Share any potential risks or challenges that might impact the project or the timeline.
   
2. **Blockers**:
   - Discuss any blockers that are preventing progress on your tasks. If applicable, suggest possible solutions or who might be able to help.

3. **Accomplishments**:
   - Briefly describe what you have completed since the last meeting. Be **verbose** to provide a clear picture of your progress and how it fits into the project goals.

4. **Future Plans**:
   - Outline your next steps and what you plan to work on before the next meeting.

Be **detailed and thorough** when providing updates, as this helps the entire team stay aligned and identify any issues early. It's better to over-communicate than under-communicate, so don’t hesitate to share as much information as possible.

### Additional Notes:
- Each team member should always have **ONE** issue in Doing.
- Once an issue is completed, **move it into QA and ping the assignee** on Slack.
- Only leads will have the responsibility of merging branches into the `main` branch after a thorough review.
